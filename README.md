Project: Disaster Management & Emergency Alert System

Problem Statement:

Disasters and emergency incidents such as floods, fires, accidents, earthquakes, and hazardous situations require immediate reporting and coordinated response. However, in many real-world scenarios, communication between citizens, authorities, and responders is slow, fragmented, and lacks real-time visibility.Victims struggle to alert authorities quickly, responders do not receive accurate location-based information, and there is no unified platform to verify incidents, dispatch responders, track status, and broadcast public alerts. This gap often leads to: Delayed rescue operations Miscommunication during emergency response Poor situational awareness Increased risk to human life and resources This project aims to solve these challenges by developing a centralized, real-time Disaster Management & Emergency Alert System that enables instant reporting, structured verification, coordinated response, and safety awareness.

Project Objective

To build a MERN-based real-time emergency reporting and alert management platform that: Allows citizens to report incidents with location, description, and media Provides an SOS alert mechanism for critical emergencies Notifies nearby users and authorities through push alerts Enables authorities to verify incidents, assign responders, and track progress Uses maps, geo-fencing, and alert zones for situational awareness Maintains incident history and analytics for decision-making and preparedness

Core Modules to be Integrated

Real-Time Incident Reporting

Location-based incident reporting Auto geo-tagging & timestamp Media upload (image/video/audio) Category-wise incident classification SOS emergency trigger

SOS Alert & Notification System

One-tap distress alert Push notifications to nearby users Zone-based emergency broadcasts Authority alert integration

Authority Dashboard

Incident review & verification Responder/volunteer assignment Status workflow: Reported → Verified → Responding → Resolved Duplicate & false report handling Activity and decision logs

Geo-Location & Alert Zone Management

Map & location services Live incident map visualization Zone-based safety alerts Heatmap insights (future scope)

Incident History & Analytics

Historical incident records Case & response tracking Insights for disaster planning

User Authentication & Role Management

Secure login & identity validation Role-based access control: Citizen | Volunteer | Responder | Authority | Admin Profile & report history

Technology Stack (MERN)

MongoDB — Geo-enabled database

Express.js + Node.js — Backend APIs & services

React — Web application interface

Socket.IO — Real-time communication

Google Maps / GeoJSON — Location & mapping services
